# Creating a server with Express

In this lesson we have learned how to create a server with Express. We have seen how to create a few responses and how to use the `res` object to send files, json or simple responses.

## Important packages

- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express):

This is the main package we have used to create the server.

- [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon):

This package is used to restart the server automatically when we make changes to the code. Is the same as `node`, but with the difference that it restarts the server when the code changes. This packages is installed as a dev dependency.

- [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan):

This package is used to log the requests to the server. Every time the server receives a request, it will log the request to the console with the method, the path and the status code.
